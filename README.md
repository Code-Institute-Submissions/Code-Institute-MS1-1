### UX

Doug's Club website aims at a broader community, targeting people from diverse backgrounds and with small time frames. A simple layout with an uncomplicated way to sign-up for the service and book classes is key. The focus is to direct people to the gym.

---

#### 1. Strategy

> The goal of this endeavour is to offer a service which will improve general well-being and help users to choose a healthier lifestyle.
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Offer a simple and fast way to sign-up for the service, to book classes and interact with the community.
>
> - Increase the perception of how a healthy lifestyle can improve general well-being.
>
> - Enlarge member's database through social media.
>
> ##### Customer Goals:
>
> - Enhanced UX design through mobile-first approach.
> - Clear and concise content, simple interaction with the system to attain a quick yet efficient visit.
> - Learn about the infrastructure of the club and its class framework through visual content.
> - Footer supplying links to Social Media.
> - Effortless sign-up service.
> - Navigation bar for a smoother navigation.
> - Diminished time to load the page and content, in order to speed up the experience.
> - Book classes on-the-fly.

#### 2. Scope

> The focus here is to achieve a version of the website with just enough features to be usable - the concept of Minimum viable product (MVP), that contains:
>
> - Catalog wiht pictures depicting the amenities of the club.
> - Map location of the club.
> - Sign-up form.
> - Straightforward UX for the users.
> - Features that match my current knowledge.
#### 3. Structure

>  On the structure plan, the effort was concentrated on prompting the user to quickly understand the layout of the page and find the content easily digestible - hence the content is structured on a bite-size framework. 
>  The gallery presents pictures of the club and are organised in a simple slide show widget with a brief description of the room - 
>  navigation bar intends to improve the returning user's experience.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf): One-page website with five sections
>
> - Home, About , Gallery, Crew and Sign-Up/Contact sections.
>
> - Navigation bar - Links to each section with a sign-in option.
>
> - Footer with social media link and copyrights.

---

#### 5. Surface

Through some research, I've found that Gym websits praise contrast between colour palettes, so I've picked darker tones in contrast with brighter colours, albeit with darker tonalities.

> ###### Colours
>
> Darker grafite tonalities, black-and-white hero image in contrast with brighter tones - to make components "jump" and to mimic moviment. 
> - I've picked a bright, deep ocean blue(#003049) for one of the background-wrappers and a leafy green(#003049) for the other. 
> - For body text, I've used a combination of regular black, whitesmoke for the bright text. For the button-togglers and the text the jumbotron, I've chosen a darker "blood red" (#AE3A21)
> 
> ###### Typography
>
> - "Teko" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for main headings. This font was picked for its hard angles, to create a stronger contrast with background-colours.
> - "Roboto" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> ###### Images
>
> The images are a representation of what a GYM would have for infrastructure, as a way for customers to see it before visiting the club.

### Testing

> - After initial wireframe design, I checked each navigation item link is working correctly to each Page. I set a _temporary_ contrasting background colour to each page to mark out each section.
> - Tested responsiveness of the wireframe using Dev Tools and confirmed basic structure looks and works well on all mobile decides from 320px, up to desktop size.
> - Tested **Logo text** in menu bar to ensure it points to the Home page.
> - Tested **About, Gallery and Contact** links in menu bar to ensure it points to each page and position correctly.
> - Tested **Social Media icons** in Footer to ensure they open the correct pages, and in a new tab on the browser.
> - Tested **Contact Us** link on About page and ensured that it points to the Contact page on the same site. 
> - Tested **Facebook Community Group** link on About page to ensure they open the correct page, and in a new tab on the browser.
> - Tested **Carousel right and left arrows** and the right arrow moves to the next image and left arrow moves to the previous image as desired. 
> - Tested **Carousel indicator bar** and images can be selected by their position by clicking on relevant bars.
> - Tested **Send** button on Contact page without any text in inputs to ensure that it provides the desired error of 'Please fill out this field' to appropriate required fields.
> - Tested **Email** entry input by not entering a valid email address. This provides the desired error of 'Please include an @ in the email address'.
> - Tested **Radio buttons** to ensure only _one option can be selected_ and that _at least one option_ is required.
> - Further testing of Responsiveness of all pages using [Google Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
> - 1. [Home Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=xFabK99FmnLzZb1GxaoAQA)
> - 2. [About Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=sdaKzF2MGaSQ6f24M7x7_g)
> - 3. [Gallery Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=UhXGW2xJswuM9ZqXZIc6YQ)
> - 4. [Contact Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=0KNaDvsBA9EPBlFwkz4IKA)
> - Tested overall site colours on [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/), a Color Contrast Accessibility Validator. Test came back with excellent results.
> - Tested [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) No errors or warnings to show.
> - Tested [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
> - 1.  Parse Error on 47 items related to CSS Variable values. Researched this and found that this is a non-issue after reading reports on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57661659/w3c-css-validation-parse-error-on-variables) and other sources. It is a requested feature on [Github](https://github.com/w3c/css-validator/issues/111) too.
> - 2.  Warning 'Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes'. Confident to ignore these after researching and a common answer is that the validator will not validate imported style sheets. See [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25946111/importing-css-is-ending-up-with-an-error).
> - Tested site URL on [Website Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/) which rendered good results. Images are on the large size in PNG format and already compressed. I chose to maintain the PNG format as the image quality of the site is integral to the UX.
> - Checked grammar and spelling throughout document.
> - Ran CSS through [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) and copied new CSS code back into style.css doc.
> - Re-ran CSS Validation and 30 warnings appeared for 'unknown vendor extension'. Confident to ignore these as answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5271955/css-parse-errors-from-a-generated-stylesheet).
> - Ran README text through [Online-Spellcheck](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) to double-check on grammar and spelling.

### Bugs and turnarounds

> - The "Crew" section had aligning issues with lack of structure. The way around was to use a code snippet I found on [WrapPixel](https://snippets.wrappixel.com/bootstrap-our-team-section/) and change the structure slightly.
> - Faced issues with spacing the rounded-pictures for the crew section. Wrapped the content in bootstrap class with flexbox properties to space them out evenly.
> - Meet the crew section had issues with image size for different devices - the rounded pictures were to big for smaller devices. Found the solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29641526/how-can-images-be-resized-using-bootstrap#:~:text=Use%20class%3D%22img%2Dresponsive,Its%20a%20bootstrap%20class).
> - Had issues to push the social media links in the footer section to the right. Wrapped the content in a bootstrap class container which uses flexbox technology to horziontally align content to the right.
> - Carousel was aligning to the left side of the page, used bootstrap class with flexbox properties to create space around the gallery and centralize it.
> - Carousel rendered too small for mobile phones, which led me to choose a different type of gallery(static) for smaller devices.
> - Bootstrap Carousel on desktop views was being cut off at the bottom and allowed no space for Gallery heading. To overcome this I wrapped the carousel in its own Bootstrap Container. Added the Gallery heading above keeping the entire site consistent.
> - Bootstrap Hamburger menu was opening fine but once clicking a link, it wasn't closing. I researched this and found the answer on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36405991/bootstrap-toggle-menu-on-one-page-site-does-not-uncollapse-when-clicked)
